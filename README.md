Search Quran words based on root(s), display meanings and lines - Learn Python and explore Quran
Thanks to quransteps.wordpress.com, I downloaded the xlsm file from. This inspired me to look for Quran words and their meanings with same root. A Python script looks for all the roots in Quran from the xlsm file and create a dictionary for the user. The dictionary saves user typing Arabic input for the root. The user can enter a numeric value (married with root) instead and would find all the words in Quran for that root along with their meanings. The script also displays the lines of Quran where the words are used.
